## working version

right now i'm working on the esp32 version in espELS.  this avoids most of the esoteric port manipulation and multitude of buttons.  I plan to use blynk or something simular to configure the parameters.  The only physical buttons planned are goign to be a 4 direction pad and a select button.


inspired by electronic leadscrew by oleg

I attempted to get the "digital_feed" to work but without a working board it was not easy.  I did manage to get the encoder pins moved and used an OLEd vs the LCD.

I believe this is GPL but no license was included in the original file.

The idea here is to create an english version of this software and perhaps make it less hardware specific.

there is an older version with english comments in teh folder "ELS Russian EN"

the gerber files for the board can be found on easyeda:  https://easyeda.com/editor#id=c7d3ea8d54d24b048a1737e8dd2e6586
